<center><h3>"JeBouquine.tn" project specifications</h3></center>
The jeBouquine company recently decided to join the ranks of the major online bookstores. The shelves already
open on the website are very diverse: Information Technology, Science and Technology, Psychology, Decoration and
Gardening. The jeBouquine bookstore ensures, in addition to French-speaking books, distribution in the English language
from a wide selection of works from the largest English and American publishers. For example, we find in the
IT department of titles from Addison-Wesley, McGraw-Hill, Oâ€™Reilly, Wiley, Wrox Press, etc.
The fundamental objective of the future site www.jeBouquine.tn is to allow Internet users to search for
works by theme, author, keyword, etc., to build a virtual basket, then to be able to order and
pay them directly on the web.
The expectations of jBouquine managers of this site are:
<ul>
  <li>Take a place in the online bookstore market in front of generalist competitors such as
www.amazon.fr, www.fnac.com or www.eyrolles.com</li>
  <li>Quickly invent differentiating elements to become in the medium term (less than two years) the
number one in Tunisia for online book sales. The website should therefore be easily upgradeable for
be able to quickly implement important new features.</li>

 Quickly invent differentiating elements to become in the medium term (less than two years) the
number one in Tunisia for online book sales. The website should therefore be easily upgradeable for
be able to quickly implement important new features.
<u>Search for books:</u>
<p>The first step for the internet user is to find a desired work as quickly as possible
throughout the catalog. The references of this work can be more or less precise, it is necessary
provide him with several different research methods. The user will be able to enter a criterion (title,
author, ISBN, etc.) or even several criteria at the same time. Search results will be available
on a particular page, and should be able to be easily browsed and reclassified.
However, if he does not have a firm idea, he must also be given the means to stroll as he would
in the shelves of a real library: for that, he can directly access a classification
thematic, new products, best sellers, etc.</p>
