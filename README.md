<center><h3>"JustGroupe.tn" project specifications</h3></center>
The JustGroupe company recently decided to join the ranks of the major online bookstores. The shelves already
open on the website are very diverse: Information Technology, Science and Technology, Psychology, Decoration and
Gardening. The jeBouquine bookstore ensures, in addition to French-speaking books, distribution in the English language
from a wide selection of works from the largest English and American publishers. For example, we find in the
IT department of titles from Addison-Wesley, McGraw-Hill, Oâ€™Reilly, Wiley, Wrox Press, etc.
The fundamental objective of the future site www.JustConnectStoreOnline.tn is to allow Internet users to search for
works by theme, author, keyword, etc., to build a virtual basket, then to be able to order and
pay them directly on the web.
The expectations of JustConnect StoreOnline managers of this site are:
<ul>
  <li>Take a place in the online bookstore market in front of generalist competitors such as
www.amazon.fr, www.fnac.com or www.eyrolles.com</li>
  <li>Quickly invent differentiating elements to become in the medium term (less than two years) the
number one in Tunisia for online book sales. The website should therefore be easily upgradeable for
be able to quickly implement important new features.</li>

<h6>Search for books:</h6>
<p>The first step for the internet user is to find a desired work as quickly as possible
throughout the catalog. The references of this work can be more or less precise, it is necessary
provide him with several different research methods. The user will be able to enter a criterion (title,
author, ISBN, etc.) or even several criteria at the same time. Search results will be available
on a particular page, and should be able to be easily browsed and reclassified.
However, if he does not have a firm idea, he must also be given the means to stroll as he would
in the shelves of a real library: for that, he can directly access a classification
thematic, new products, best sellers, etc.</p>
<h6>Discovery of works:</h6>
<p>Each book sold on the site www.JustConnectStoreOnline.tn will be presented in detail on its own page.
will find in particular:
<ul>
  <li>an image (for most works) that the user can enlarge,</li>
  <li>its price and availability,</li>
  <li>comments from readers who are already customers,</li>
  <li>the detailed table of contents, extracts from chapters, etc.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h6>Selection of books:</h6>
<p>In a real store, the customer chooses his articles one after the other, deposits them in his
basket, then goes to the cashier to settle everything. Merchant websites try to reproduce these
buying habits as faithfully as possible.
So, when the user is interested in a work, he can save it in a virtual basket. He must
then be able to add, delete or modify the quantities at any time before
place an order.</p>
<h6>Order of works:</h6>
<p>At any time, the customer must be able to access the order form, in which he enters his
contact details and information necessary for payment and delivery. To guarantee security and
confidentiality of exchanges, it is imperative that the sending of data is done in an encrypted manner. In
if the customer wishes, the system must be able to print a quote to order
by fax or mail. The customer should then be able to follow his recent orders, and even the
modify before shipment, securely.
Generally speaking, the customer should be able to manage their account, i.e. change their contact details,
preferences, add addresses, etc.</p>
<h6>Quality requirements</h6>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Sober and efficient ergonomics
<p>Buying a book on the web doesn't have to take a lot of time or require a mastery of
math! The layout of the site will make the process as easy as possible with the help of a
clear and intuitive presentation. Sites that are too rich and too complex do not encourage people to buy because they
  require significant and unwanted intellectual effort.</p></li>
  <li>Simple order form
<p>Very often, the user stalls when buying, because the most important effort to make is
order form information!
The concept<p></li>
</ul>
</p>
<h6>Performance requirements</h6>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The JustConnect StoreOnline must be able to manage the accounts of more than 10,000 customers.</li>
<li>The website must support more than 1,000 simultaneous connections.</li>
<li>The catalog of works must be able to include more than 1,000,000 titles.</li>
<li>No search should take more than 2 seconds.</li>
</ul></p>
